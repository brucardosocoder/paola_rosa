Please note that screening is required for all new suitors, and the process may vary depending on individual circumstances. Once we've agreed on the time and location, a deposit will be requested to secure the booking. After the deposit is received, our date will be officially confirmed, and you'll receive a booking confirmation with all the necessary details. Please refer to the Booking page for full information regarding my screening and deposit policy.</p>

For those who prefer more privacy, you may also use Throne or purchase a physical Amazon or Uber gift card with cash from a store — simply send a clear photo of the code to avoid typing errors.</p>

                                <p>It could be that I need a little extra time, as I handle all my bookings personally. Please be patient and allow up to 48 hours for a reply. You're welcome to send a follow-up message once or twice, just in case. If you've reached out but haven't heard back within that time, it's possible your message didn't follow the etiquette outlined on my website. I value quality over quantity and deeply appreciate those who take the time to read through my site before contacting me — it reflects genuine interest and a willingness to invest in a meaningful connection.

                                <p>For regular suitors, I do my best to accommodate within one or two hours, but I prefer that dates are scheduled well in advance. For first-timers, I kindly ask for at least three hours from the time we finalize the booking. Screening and coordination take time, and I love getting ready and ensuring every detail is perfect for both of us. After all, the more time — the merrier.

                                <p>Absolutely! These encounters hold a special place in my heart. I also offer discounted rates for women, trans individuals, and fellow sex workers.</p>

                                <p>I'm open to filming or photographing with my own device, as I value my privacy and like to maintain full control over any content that may be created. All footage will be carefully edited so you can receive a tasteful copy as a way to remember our time together. The cost will depend on the duration of the video and the post-production time required, and all content is intended strictly for personal use — not for resale or distribution.</p>

                                <p>Simply let me know what you have in mind, and I'll make sure to accommodate your preference for a $60 fee. It's best to make your request at the time of booking at least 48 hours in advance so I can ensure the desired outfit is prepared. Please note that outfit requests apply to lingerie, undergarments, or playful costumes, and not to wardrobe pieces, but don't worry! I always arrive at dates immaculately presented. If you'd like me adorned in specific clothing, shoes, or jewelry please bring new, unworn items for our time together. I'll happily model them for you. My measurements are 36C, 29, 42, shoes size 9 wide. You can take a look at my wishlist for inspiration! The fee is waived if you provide the piece you'd like me to wear.</p>

                                <p>I'm happy to, but I would appreciate a heads-up if you plan to use me as a reference, before another provider reaches out. Personally, I don't rely on references as a screening method, as I find there are more reliable and discreet ways to ensure safety and compatibility. I feel that each person's experience is their own, and it doesn't always reflect on how we might connect.</p>

                                <p>For my existing lovers — absolutely! I prioritize building meaningful, long-term relationships and would be happy to discuss the details further. Please feel free to contact me to explore what might suit us both. Just a gentle reminder: monthly arrangements simply mean I'm open to offering a monthly rate for clients who wish to pre-book specific dates and times in advance for the month. Like any pre-booking, a 30% deposit is required for each session.</p>

                                <p>I am a social drinker. I don't personally smoke or use other substances, but I hold no judgment about anyone's personal choices. For our FIRST time together, please arrive sober. If you wish, I'm happy to share a glass of wine or a light drink during our time together. I prefer to keep alcohol consumption to a minimum, unless we already know each other well enough and you've explicitly expressed that you're comfortable with more. While I understand sobriety is a standard requirement for many, I am comfortable if you are not, as long as your conduct remains respectful, consensual, and does not push any boundaries. I believe in creating a non-judgmental space where we can both relax and connect naturally, trusting you to manage your consumption responsibly.</p>
